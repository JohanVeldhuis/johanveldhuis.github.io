[![Google Earth](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google_earth.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/google_earth.jpg "Google Earth")

I found a nice feature on the internet for Google Earth. I was looking on <a href="http://www.nu.nl" target="_blank">NU.nl</a>Â and saw that a South-African guy discovered that you can fly with Google Earth. I tried it myself and it&#8217;s really cool. You can start flying from different airports (unfortunately not Dutch airports) or you can start flying at the point where you are at that time. When you start using it in flightsimulator mode you can choose pbetween a jet or propeller airplane. It&#8217;s nice to try for one time but flying with a real flightsimulator is nicer.
