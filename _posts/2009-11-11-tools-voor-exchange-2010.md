Exchange 2010 is now available for a few days and besides Exchange itself there are the tools.

Today Microsoft launched the second tool, the Exchange Deployment Assistant. This web based tool will first ask you a few questions and then will help you step by step how to migrate successfully to Exchange 2010.

If you would like to see the tool yourself have a look at the site mentioned at the end of this blog.

Besides this tool there is the E2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculator. This tool will help you to size your mailbox server by asking several questions. On the Exchange Teamblog Ross Smith IV has written an article about this tool and how it works.

Below you will find the links to the tools
