Today I&#8217;ve spend somte time on the forums of MsExchange.org and Technet. I have a look at both regulary last time to look what are the issues pople have with Exchange 2007 and to help them. The last thing is pretty nice sometimes it are easy issues and sometimes very difficult. In the meantime I am busy preparing fot the 70-237Â (Designing Messaging Solutions with MS Exchange Server 2007) exam. I&#8217;ve learned a lot from the books who could be very handy to use. This week I will try to publish a tutorial, maybe multiple tutorials but that depends on the time I have. But you will see the result yourself when you visit my site.
