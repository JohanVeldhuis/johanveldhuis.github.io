Webwereld publishes a message on their site which claims to crack the masterpassword of the iPhone. On the phone their is a file called 694-5259.dmg which is not encrypted. I a dmg file all the settings for a user are saved: username, coded password etc. This is what experts are not recommanding for years. Most times there&#8217;s a shadowfile which contains the passwords.
