Since tweaking some things in Vista the network and volume icon where not available anymore. Tonight I decided to google on it and I am not the only person who has this issue. There appeared to be a KB article from Microsoft about it. After reading the article and performing the suggestions I could enable the icons via the Control Panel. The network icon isÂ indispensable. In the KB article everything is explained even how the issue is caused. It appears that when the system is very busy during startup specific values can&#8217;t beÂ established because of a time-out. I have them back in any case ðŸ˜‰
