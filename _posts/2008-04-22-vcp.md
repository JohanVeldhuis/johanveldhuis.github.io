Today after a few weeks waiting I received the certificate for VMware Certified Professional.Â  A few weeks ago I did exam and I past. The nice thing about this certification is that you do not only get a certificate but also a license for VMWare Workstation 6. This is very cool, from most vendors you only receive a certificate. Maybe a tip for other vendors to give goodies like this instead of only a certificate.
