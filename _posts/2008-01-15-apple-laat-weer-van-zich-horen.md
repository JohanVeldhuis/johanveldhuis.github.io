[![Apple laat weer van zich horen](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/145755-dsc_0051.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/145755-dsc_0051.jpg "Apple laat weer van zich horen")

As expected the Keynote from Steve was a lot of bacon hoist. Apple released the MacBook Air. At this moment the smalles notebook. The new notebook has a Led backlit 13.3&#8243;, ambient light sensor, 1.8&#8243; hard driveÂ and 2 GB memory. The strange thing is that the notebook does not have an optical drive by default. It it possible to order a superdrive for it, but that one would be external. This is not the only thing that is strange, the user can&#8217;t replace the battery him/herself. You can choose for a normal hd or a 64 GB solid state disk. Besides this features the notebook has also onboard Blue Tooth and a Wireless N-card. Besides the new MacBook Apple will bring out a new Auroport Extreme. This will contain a 500 GB or 1 TB disk. I must say that I am quite impressed Apple suprises the world again. Now it&#8217;s just waiting till they are available at the shops.
