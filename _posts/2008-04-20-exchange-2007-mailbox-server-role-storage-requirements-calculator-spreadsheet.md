Maybe you found it already, but I found it this week. The Storage Requirements Calculator from the Exchange Team.

This tool can be used when desinging the storage environment for you Exchange 2007 environment. With this tool yoiu can for example determine what the storage requirements are (I/O Performance and capacity) and determine the optimal LUN design.

The tool can be downloaded for free from the Exchange Team website.
