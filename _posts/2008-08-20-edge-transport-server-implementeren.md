It&#8217;s time for another tutorial, this one is about the Edge Transport server. This server will be placed between the Hub Transport server and the internet and most times it will be placed in the DMZ. On this server it&#8217;s possible to enable the same anti-spam agent as on the Hub Transport server. This will prevent mails reaching the Hub Transport server and block them directly when they arrive at the companies mail gateway.
