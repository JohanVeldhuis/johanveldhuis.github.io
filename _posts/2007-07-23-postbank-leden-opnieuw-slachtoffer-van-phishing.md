Members of the Postbank are victim again due to new phishing mails. The page tries to seduce members to login to a &#8220;fake&#8221; loginpage. The Postbank is now working hard to get this &#8220;fake&#8221; site offline. Customers who had logged in need to change their username and password directly via Postbank.nl
