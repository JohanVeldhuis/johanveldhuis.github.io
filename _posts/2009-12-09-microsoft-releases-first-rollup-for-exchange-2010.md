Today Microsoft has release rollup 1 for Exchange 2010. This is the first update for Exchange 2010 which fixes the following issues:

  * VSS backup doesn&#8217;t react anymore when creating a VSS backup of the Exchange 2010 databases.
  * Some attachments could not be opened in Outlook Web App.
  * Exchange RPC access crashes.
  * Meeting requests which are sent to meeting rooms will not be processed.
  * Folders can&#8217;t be renamed when moving them with CopyFolder (IMAP) and then renaming it.
  * Location is not updated when a meeting is modified.
