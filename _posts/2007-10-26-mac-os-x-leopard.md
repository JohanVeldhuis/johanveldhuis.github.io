[![Mac OS X Leopard](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/62903.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/62903.jpg "Mac OS X Leopard")

Today Mac OS X Leopard is available for everyone. Leopard contains improvements for SpotLight, Finder and the dock. Beside that we will get rid of the &#8220;classis&#8221; applications. Apple did take a long time to release the new version. I took 2,5 years to complete the new version of OS X. The systemrequirements are a lot heavier then the previous versions the system needs a DVD drive and a minimum of 512 MB.
