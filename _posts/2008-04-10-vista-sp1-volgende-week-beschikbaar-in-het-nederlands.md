According to multiplte site Microsoft will release Servicepack 1 containing 36 languages, also Dutch. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want to give the exact release date on an official press conference. The servicepack will be 500 MB for 32-bits systems and 700 MB for 64-bits systems.

We will have to wait what the exact release day of the servicepack.
