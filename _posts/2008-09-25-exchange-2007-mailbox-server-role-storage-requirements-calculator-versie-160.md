The guys from the Microsoft Exchange Team have worked on a new version of the Storage Requirements Calculator. This week version 16 is released of the Mailbox Server Role Storage Requirements Calculator. It&#8217;s a very useful tool when you need to determine what are the storage requirements for your mailbox server.
