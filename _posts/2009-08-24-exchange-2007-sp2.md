If everything goes OK Exchange 2007 Service Pack 2 will be released tonight and else tomorrow. That&#8217;s what a post from Paul Rowden (Release Manager Exchange Development) will tell you. Paul posted the text below:

Additionally, Exchange 2007 SP2, which releases tomorrow will also contain the same AD schema extensions as Exchange 2010.

So now it&#8217;s just waiting for the links to be available but it won&#8217;t take long I think. Now SP2 will be released it&#8217;s officially supported to have Exchange 2010 RC can run in the same organization as Exchange 2007. One of the pre-requisits is that you need Exchange 2007 SP2. The SP will contain new schema extensions which are also used with Exchange 2010 RC.
