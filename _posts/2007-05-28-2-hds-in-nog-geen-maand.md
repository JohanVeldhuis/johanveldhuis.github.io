[![Maxtor hd](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/maxtor.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/maxtor.jpg "Maxtor hd")

Today my second hard drive crashed. I had some photo&#8217;s on this one and I didn&#8217;t have a backup. I had an old 60 GB IDE disk so I put it in my pc and installed Windows on it. I haven&#8217;t had it earlier two defective drives in suchÂ a short time. Now I first have to send it back to Maxtor and then have to wait several weeks before getting the new one I guess.
