This week I had a really extreme situation with a server. For some reason I couldn&#8217;t install a specific patch for a program on the server. After some investigation a file which can&#8217;t be copied was the issue. First thing was rebooting it, that didn&#8217;t solve the issue. After that there was only one option left, but I wouldn&#8217;t like to use this option on a server. After a talk with another person we decided to do it. We killed all files from unknown processes and stopped all services which were not nescessary. Then tried to install the patch again, and guess what, it worked this time. Safed by control shift escape.
