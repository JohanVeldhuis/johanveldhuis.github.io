Today I visited Microsoft and heard the SP1 for Exchange will be released tomorrow. I had a look at the site a few minutes ago and you already download it. Besides the bugfixes SP1 will contain a few new functions which were not ready or not met the criterea when the RTM was released. This SP will introduce a new wat to create a redundant environment called Standby Continuous Replication and Exchange 2007 on Windows 2008 is now supported.
