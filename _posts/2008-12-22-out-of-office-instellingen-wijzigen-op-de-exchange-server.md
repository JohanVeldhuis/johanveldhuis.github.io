Nice that users can define Out Of Office settings but what can you configure as an administrator for the Out Of Office settings. More then you think, besides this there are a few nice features in Exchange 2007 which prevent unnecessary OOF messages.

In this tutorial I will explain the administrator side of OOF, I will explain how you can configure it per remote domain and per user.
