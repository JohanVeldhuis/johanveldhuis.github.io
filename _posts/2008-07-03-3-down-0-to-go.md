Today I passed the 70-238 exam, which results in that I am now MCITP: Enterprise Messaging Administrator ðŸ˜‰ Examination went wel l must say, however,Â it was more difficult compared to the other two examinations of Exchange 2007. But it&#8217;s in the pocket now. In the meantimeÂ I amÂ busy withÂ some beta tests of a new product of Trend Micro for scanning IMÂ traffic of OCS.Â  The OCS testingÂ has stalledÂ this because I do not hadÂ much time but I think this will change.
