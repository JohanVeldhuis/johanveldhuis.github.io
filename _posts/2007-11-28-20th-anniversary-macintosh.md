I found this one on the site <a href="http://www.apple-history.com" target="_blank">apple-history.com</a>. It&#8217;s more then 20 years ago that Apple released the 20th Anniversary Macintosh. This model was released because of the 20th anniversary of Apple. The Mac contained a PowerPC 603ev processor who ran at 250 MHz. Besided that the Mac contained a tv-kaart, a 20 gb hd, 1.4MB Superdrive and 4 speed cd-rom drive. The model was brought out with a very cool speaker. I&#8217;ve seen this model myself a few times and the sound that comes out of the speakers is really good.
