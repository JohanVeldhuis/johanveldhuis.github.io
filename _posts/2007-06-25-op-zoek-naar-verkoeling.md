[![Thermaltake](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/thermaltake.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/thermaltake.jpg "Thermaltake")

I did some research on looking why the hd crashed, I think it was a thermal issue. I seached on several sites and found several solutions among with: Thermaltake Hardcano 14.  It will cost you a 5&#8217;25 slot but then I will have two left. I hope this thing will cool down the harddrive that is one his way back now. The nicest on that it that I will get a 300 GB back while I send a 200 GB, so 100 GB for free. It&#8217;s better then the 60 GB IDE harddrive which is in the system at the moment. This one gets very hot also, while extracting and parring the temperature exceeds 50 degrees. Now it&#8217;s just waiting for the parts, I expect the Hardcone tomorrow. I will publish the experience with it on my site.
