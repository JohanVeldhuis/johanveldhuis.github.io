[![Trend Micro Internet Security Beta](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/trend1.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/trend1.jpg "Trend Micro Internet Security Beta")

This weekend I did some BETA testing. This time for Trend Micro, they release a BETA version of the new Internet Security. The installation went OK it detected the current package and removed it. But then the problems started the update function didn&#8217;t worked but no reason was specified. The I ran a full scan, after 4 hour scanning I stopped it. You can&#8217; see what is the progress in the program so very irritating. You can&#8217;t shutdown Windows normally because Trend has a buildin check to check if there is a scan running. So I need to hold the powerbutton to shutdown my machine. After a reboot I did a manual scan . Here you can see how long the program needs to complete the scan. The buildin SPAM filter implements itself in you e-mail client it looked good on first sight. After several minutes it gave an error and crashed. Yeah it could happen it&#8217;s a BETA but an other Trend Micro Service blocked Dr Watson so no crash info could be created this caused a loop. The only solution was swichting of the service and then force quit the SPAM service. So a lot os issues in the first BETA, Trend has to do a lot of work on it before it&#8217;s ready.
