As you may already know a lot of funtions from Exchange 2007 are using certificates. Microsoft has released a tool a while ago which can check certificates that are used for certificate based authentication for ActivSync. I just found it while surfing the internet en thought maybe it&#8217;s nice so that&#8217;s why I published it on my site. You can download the tool via the link below:
