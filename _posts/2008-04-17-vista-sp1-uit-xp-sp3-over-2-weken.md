As you may now Microsoft has released the second wave of Vista SP1. In this wave the Dutch version is also included. Last night I downloaded and installed it immediately. The shutdown proces goes faster then before the update ðŸ˜‰ On 29 april Microsoft will release Microsoft XP Servicepack 3.Â  In the servicepack there will be a few new functions en according to earlier beta reviews it should be a lot faster too.
