The last 1.5 week I&#8217;ve been busy with Microsoft Office Communications server 2007 with a colleague and another colleague from France. It was really cool to work again with the product. For the occasion there was also a Microsoft Rountable camera arranged, a really nice gadget. Now we are going to do more tests and play with our new OCS test environment where we can be proud off I think.  The archiving option is the only thing I am not pleased about, I think it&#8217;s not entirely finished yet. You must make  reports yourself in SQL or use a 3rd party product. Of course we integrated  OCS with Exchange Voice access I think many people will like that option. May I find some nice stuff I will put it on my blog.
