The last step before you can play with the UM functions of Exchange is a telephone.

Not everybody has a IP-PBX and a phone to test with, of course there are some opensource packages. One of them is SIPX which can be uses as a PBX and then you could use a softphone as a phone if you like.

But why should do that if Microsoft has it&#8217;s own UM Testphone.  You can install it on a client to try somethings. In this tutorial I will explain how you can install the UMTestphone and configure it.
