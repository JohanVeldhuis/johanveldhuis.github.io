Microsoft has just released version 2 of the latest Exchange 2010 SP1 and SP2 rollups. At this moment you can&#8217;t find a lot of information about it. The only reference which can be found on the dowload pages of both rollups is a reference to security bulletin MS12-058. In this security bulletin an issue is described about a vulnerability in the Web Ready Document Viewing functionality of Exchange 2010 in the Oracle Outside In Libraries

The updates can be downloaded via the links below:

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Update: this updates rollup has been released because of the expiration of the signatures which are used to sign the code. The advice is to install the v2 of the rollup despite it was already a part of the v1 of this update.</span>
