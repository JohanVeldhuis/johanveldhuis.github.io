Today an engineer from KPN came along to look at this issue we have. After some measuring he came to the conclusion that the capacity of the line is not enough. The engineer told us that Xs4all needs to decrease the speed of the line (I already decreased from basic to lite) so I think the new speed will be 4 Mb. But that&#8217;s enough for the things we do with the internet connection, it will take one week before the change is done, so we will have to wait for one week ðŸ˜‰
