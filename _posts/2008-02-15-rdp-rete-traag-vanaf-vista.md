This week I had a nice issue with Vista. A new server was very slow when using RDP to connect to it, when working via the console on the server everything was OK. After some troubleshooting I started searching on Google. And soon I found out that I was not the only one who had this issue. A few simple commands will solve the issue: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled in some cases you need to type in some additional commands: netsh interface tcp set global rss=disabled the first sollution helped for me. The feature that is switched off is Autotuning, according to some websites, this will send/receive larger packages the XP did, not every router/switch can handle this.
