Maybe you have seen this tool before, maybe you don&#8217;t, but this nice piece of software you really want to see.  With the device emulator you can emulate Windows Mobile 5 as well as Windows Mobile 6. This is really usefull when testing push mail from Exchange. The installation is very easy and you can find the both OS-es really easy and download them just as the tool for free.

If your interested, then you can find the tool on the site below.
