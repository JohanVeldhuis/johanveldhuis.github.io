As you may now already you can do quiet a lot of things with Powershell in Exchange 2007. There are some risks, one of this commands is _remove-mailbox._ The name will let you think that you only remove the mailbox from a user but with this command the user is also removed.

If you only need to delete the mailbox then use the commandÂ _disable-mailbox_ this removes the Exchange-attributes, after this the mailbox can be purged.
