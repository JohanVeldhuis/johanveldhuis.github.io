That were the words of David Rand (CTO Trend Micro) yesterday on the Trend Micro University. He showed us statistics of the amount of published malicious codes in the first trimester. There has been an explosion; for a long time it was stable in 2007 but in the 2008 the amount exploded. This causes that the virus patterns grow to very huge files. Trend will bring a lot of new things in the following months, I can&#8217;t say much about it because the information was only for partners and not for the world.
