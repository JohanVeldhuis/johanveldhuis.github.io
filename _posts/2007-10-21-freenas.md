Always want to have your own storagesolution at home ? The FreeNAS maybe is the thing you are looking for. FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD. The package will contain CIFS, NFS, FTP, en AFP to share your files. Users can me created in a local database, NIS, Radius or even Active Directory. Personally I think it is a very nice product. Another advantage is that a lot of developers are working on it so there will be new versions very fast. If you want to have a look you could try it in a virtual environment.
