It has been a few days ago since Microsoft has release Rollup 8 for Exchange 2007 SP1. I was pretty busy the last few days so that&#8217;s why the post is a little bit later then normal..

Rollup 8 contains fixes for several issues a few of them are displayed below:

  * Exchange Information store stops spontaneously
  * Meeting request from external senders will be displayed as busy instead of tentative
  * Calender permissions will get reset when you use the set-mailboxcalendersettings
  * Users can&#8217;t open the addressbook in OWA
  * EdgeTransport.exe  crashes continuously

For a full overview of fixes visit the site below..

The update can be downloaded from the download-center and will be available on May 26 via Microsoft update.
