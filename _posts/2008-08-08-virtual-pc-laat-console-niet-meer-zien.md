Since yesterday I had a nice issue with Virtual PC, the console wouldn&#8217;t open anymore. The icon was visible in the taskbar so I could start a VM from there. After some searching on the internet I found out that I was nog the only one who had this issue, below 3 solutions I found that you could try:

  * Close Virtual PC and delete the following fileÂ <span style="color: #000080; font-family: Courier New;">%appdata%\Microsoft\Virtual PC\Options.xml</span>.Â  Warning!, all you gloab configuration settings will be lost.
  * Use thisÂ <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2006/05/16/599615.aspx" target="_blank">page</a> as an example to edit theÂ Options.xml, change the values of left\_position and top\_position to a smaller value.
  * Start Virtual PC and pressÂ _ALT, Left Arrow, Down Arrow, m, Left Arrow_ and move the mouse, you should be able to see the console again.

If this tips won&#8217;t work then the only solution is to reinstall Virtual PC, in my case this was the solution ðŸ˜‰
