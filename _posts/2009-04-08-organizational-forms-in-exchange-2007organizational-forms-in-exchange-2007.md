It has been a while ago since my last tutorial, today it&#8217;s time for a new tutorial. In this tutorial I will explain how you can configure Organizational forms in Exchange 2007. Organizational forms can be used to publish forms that can be accessed by every user who has access to Exchange.

Several applications are using this option, one of them is Commvault Mailbox Archiver.
