Maybe you have seen that the site was offline for a while. The server is not standing near my desk so I had to go onsite to look why it wasn&#8217;t working. It may sound stupid but it was the network-cable which caused the issue. On the server the led&#8217;s from the NIC weren&#8217;t burning anymore, I thought is the NIC defecive after such a short period ? Another cable solved the issue. Now let&#8217;s hope there happens nothing strange with this one.
