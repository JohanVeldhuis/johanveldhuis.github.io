If the last times you got the message that the site didn&#8217;t exist anymore then this could be right. The server was crashed and I needed some time to buy a new one and install all the software on it. Today the server is fully operational. I found a lot of little issues but I solved al of them. The server is just like the picture above. It contains a duo Core CPU on 2 Ghz, 1 GB memory and a 160 GB SATA disk. This weel I will add some items on how I resolved some issues maybe you can use them when you have the same issues.
