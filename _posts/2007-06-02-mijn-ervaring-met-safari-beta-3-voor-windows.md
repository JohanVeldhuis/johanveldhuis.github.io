Just back from holiday and saw the Beta for Safari 3 for Windows was released. I thought why not trying it, because I have worked with Apple before so I downloaded and installed it. The fun was for a short time, when pasting something in a field the browser crashed completely. I tried it on another machine but that didn&#8217;t solve the issue also. Surfing the internet works OK but it&#8217;s not faster what Apple claims. Plug-ins sich as Flash need to be installed manually and doesn&#8217;t go automatically. Also the browser has some issues with displaying links on pages which contain Java and PHP. I know we are talking about a Beta version so the final version would be better I guess.

My conclusion is that there is a lot of work to be done before the final version is ready.
