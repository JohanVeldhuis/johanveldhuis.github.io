Today I passed the 70-237 exam I only have to pass one to upgrade my Exchange to 2007. I read some articles on the internet that this exam should be easier as the 70-236 and with a good preparationÂ  it went well indeed. I passed with a score of 968 points, so not bad. In the meantime I am busy at the Exchange forums where I start to feel confertable. I answered a lot of questions and learned some new things so that&#8217;s nice.
