[![Windows Vista crash](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/17112007.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/17112007.jpg "Windows Vista crash") 

This weekend my brother had a big problem with his laptop. While installing some updates his laptop went off because to less battery. After turning it on again the only thing what was displayed wast this screen. I knew their could be some issues after installing some updates but I was not sure if this was that issue. I started the laptop in safe mode, but even that didn&#8217;t worked. After trying somethings in the registry we could backup the data and reinstall the laptop. This because they guys from HP only deliver a restore DVD and not a normal Windows installation disc.
