This weekend I got an e-mail from Trend that there was a new build available. Yesterday I downloaded itÂ and after removing the old build it started with installing. The only thing that needed to be changed was a registry key because else updating didn&#8217;t worked. Eventually they didn&#8217;t helped because auto updating didn&#8217;t worked very well. The new build contains fixes for issue that I had with the first build so that good, I had some problems with the SPAM engine which now are gone. No we have to wait till auto update works.
