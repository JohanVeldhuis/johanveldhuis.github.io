Today I became a member of Technorati to become a part of their list. That&#8217;s why I posted this message on my site, they use it to confirm that I am the owner of it. Google uses the same method for their Webmaster tools. You have to put a META tag on your website or upload a HTML file with a name they give. Now it&#8217;s just at matter of time to be added to their site if all things are OKÂ ðŸ˜‰
