It has been a very long time ago since I have wrote my last blog. Multiple things happened in my life which resulted in no time to write blogs anymore: finished my study, work, family etc. This weekend I decided to pickup blogging again.

As you might already have seen a few things have changed: moved away from Wordpress, changed website layout and last change was completed this week changing my domain from johanveldhuis.nl to myuclab.nl.

In the coming weeks I will write several blogs. Focus of the blogs will remain the same although it will probably be more Lync/Skype and Teams related since I have changed focus.
