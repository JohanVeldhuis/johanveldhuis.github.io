It looks like we can expect Exchange 2010 SP3 very soon. There are a lot of rumors on going on Twitter and Facebook the Microsoft Downloads already contains the Exchange 2010 SP3 UM Language Pack.

A question by Exchange fan Hakim Taoussi that it has been announced but not available:

Was answered by Bharat Suneja from the MsExchange team with the following tweet:

So for those who have been waiting till they can migrate to Exchange 2013 from Exchange 2010 you should be able soon. If it is wise to do it, well read the several blog posts from [Exchange guys](http://theessentialexchange.com/blogs/michael/archive/2013/01/06/exchange-server-2013-gotchas.aspx) and then rethink your decission again.
