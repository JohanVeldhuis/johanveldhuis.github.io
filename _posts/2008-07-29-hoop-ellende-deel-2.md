Today I contacted Xs4all againÂ since InternetÂ was not working sinceÂ 23:00.Â This morning I rebooted the modem several timsÂ but unfortunately no success. As agreed with the helpdesk I called back todayÂ and happy I was rapidly put through with 2nd line. There I got a personÂ on the line which asked several questions and tried some things. Conclusion:Â Xs4all can&#8217;t do anything about it and needs to put it through their networksupplier (if think it&#8217;s KPN),Â  for a network measuring. No problem on the first sightÂ only then the person told me that it lasts 3 up to 6 working days before they have carried out the test. After theÂ telephone call we putted back the splitter-device .Â  And after that it worked, I wonder myself for how long ğŸ˜‰Â I looked at the logging of the modem itÂ goes down and up and down and up ; -)

So now we have to wait forÂ 3Â  to 6 working days perhaps then we know where the problem is caused by, or maybe the problem dissapears spontaneously. ğŸ˜‰
