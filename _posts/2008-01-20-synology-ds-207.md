Yes I received my new gadget the Synology DS-207+. It&#8217;s a NAS from Synology with a lot of options. It has a build-in web-server(with php and mysql), ftp-server, possibility to stream audio and a file server option. Besides the default options you can extend the box with iPKG files. This makes it possible to put SABnzb on it and I can tell you it works pretty good. In the Synology there is space for 2 harddisks and you can configure them as a RAID 0 or RAID 1. Soon you will here more about my experiences with the DS-207+.
