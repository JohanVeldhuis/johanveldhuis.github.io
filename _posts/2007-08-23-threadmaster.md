Maybe you had the issue once in a Citrix environment, some processes take 100& CPU time for a long period.Â  This is a nice program to have a look at. Threadmaster keeps an eye on the processes en takes action if necessary. The only thing that is missing is the GUI, if you want to make changes you need to do it via the registry.
