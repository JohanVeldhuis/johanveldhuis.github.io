Today I received the e-mail below:

Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2009 MicrosoftÂ® MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in Exchange Server technical communities during the past year.

I am really happy with this award, it&#8217;s a nice appreciation from Microsoft. Ofcourse I will continue with updating my site so keep an eye on it.
