When I was busy with the piece about _Backscatters_ I was busy on this tutorial about anti-spam already. I completed the tutorial today, it is a quite long tutorial, this because of the many types of anti-spam agents that are default included in Exchange 2007. When you really want to do it right then you should install a seperate Edge Transport server in your DMZ and activate the anti-spam agents on it. Have a lot of fun reading this tutorial.
