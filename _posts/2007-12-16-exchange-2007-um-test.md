So it&#8217;s time for an update on my site. The last time I did not have many time to update my website. The last few weeks I experimentated with Exchange 2007 and especially the UM part. Microsoft did real good work and when you hear the things they are planning for the future then the competitors should worry. If you are experimentating with Exchange 2007 also but you don&#8217;t have a SIP-server then you should try the Exchange UMtestphone. You can find the tool within the bin directory of Exchange. On Technet you can find a manual on how to set it up. I think I will make a tutorial for it this week how you can get it working on a client.
