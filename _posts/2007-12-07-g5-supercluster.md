A few years ago the Virginia Tech build a Supercluster of G5 machines. This movie will give you a good impression how they did it. The supercluter exists of 1100 Powermac G5&#8217;s en they are 7th on the list of supercomputers. In the meantime all Powermac G5&#8217;s have been replaced by Xserve G5&#8217;s.
