Such as your perhaps already have seen I now &#8221; really&#8221; have my own domain: myuclab.nl. The problems I had each time the internet connection went down were driving me crazy. I  decided to host my website somewhere else and go for a new address. Must say that it went really quick, the things that cost me a lot of time where transfering my website from the old server to the new one, especially when the line goes up and down. But well it has succeeded and all the content has been transferred  as far as I can see. Now I have to get my status at all search engines back. In the meantime I am also very busy to translate texts to English  because I could see regularly people outsite the Netherlands and Belgium where visiting my site. For those people have a bit more patience it is quite a lot of work; -)
