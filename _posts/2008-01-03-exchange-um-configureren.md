As promised a while ago I would create a new tutorial.

The last period I&#8217;ve played a lot with Exchange 2007 UMÂ so I thought it would be nice to create a tutorial about that.

This is the first tutorial where I will explain how you can configure Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging. I will make some more tutorials in a short time now. Have a lot of fun reading it.
