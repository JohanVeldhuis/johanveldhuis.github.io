Yes I passed the exam today, 70-236 with a score of 962 points. I did some research on the internet and heard some stories that it was a hard exam so I did prepare myself well before doing the exam. Now up to the next exam 70-237 there are no books for this exam so I will have to look how I can prepare for this exam. For those who are planning to do the 70-236 exam I can recommend the MS Press book.
