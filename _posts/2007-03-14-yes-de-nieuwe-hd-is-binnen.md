Yesterday I received one of my defective harddrives. And it was a 300 GB instead of the 200 GB I sent, so 100 GB for free ðŸ˜‰ I put it in theÂ Hardcano 14Â  and installed a clean OS on it. The case is working well the temprature doesn&#8217;t go above the 38. When you leave the system alone the temperature will drop very fast. This is something else then my temporarily IDE disk who got 50 degrees and was very slow. Another advantage of the new disk is that itÂ supports NCQ. With this method the read/write actions are execute more precise. For a full description see Wikipedia.
