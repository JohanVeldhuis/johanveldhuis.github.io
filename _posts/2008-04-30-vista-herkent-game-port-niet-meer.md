Yesterday I decided to build in my &#8220;old&#8221; soundcard because I removed my SCSI card because I didn&#8217;t need it anymore. I was surprised to found out that Vista doesn&#8217;t recognize the game-port anymore. I started to google and found out that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t support it anymore, Microsoft assumes that you use a USB joystick instead of one you could connect to the gameport. After some research I got to the <a href="http://www.creative.com" target="_blank">Creative Labs</a> webpage via  <a href="http://www.tweakers.net" target="_blank">Tweakers</a> there has been some very active with writing a new game-poort drivr for Vista. Do you also have the same issue and would like the driver, then click on the link below.
