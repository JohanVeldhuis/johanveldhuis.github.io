Yesterday I passed theÂ  Citrix XenServer Enterprise Edition 4.0: Administration exam. There were a view cumbersome questions, which you need to think twice before answering them. But I passed and that&#8217;s the most important. Xenserver from Citrix is a really nice product with nice features in it, it does not have all options compared with Vmware ESX at the moment. But Citrix will go further with developing and at this moment version 4.1 is available and has a ot of new features. I&#8217;m wondering who will win: Citrix, Microsoft or Vmware it&#8217;s just a matter of time before we know.
