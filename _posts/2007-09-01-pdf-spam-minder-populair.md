The amount of SPAM messages containing PDF files with spam has decreased this month. According to Sophos this can only mean one thing, this type of SPAM doesn&#8217;t work. On the 7 of August there was an increase of the amount of spam messages. The cause ot this was the PDF spam that then was used, since then the amount of spam has decreased.
