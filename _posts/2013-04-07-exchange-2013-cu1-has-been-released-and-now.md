Last week Exchange 20130 CU1 was released by Microsoft. It was a little bit later then originally planned but cudo&#8217;s for Microsoft to announce it publicly that the first CU for Exchange would arrive later then expected.

CU1 contains several fixes and enhancements. If you would like to know more about those have a look at the following blogs::

[Exchange 2010 RTM CU1 released](http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/04/02/released-exchange-server-2013-rtm-cumulative-update-1.aspx)

[High Availability Changes in Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 1](http://blogs.technet.com/b/scottschnoll/archive/2013/04/02/high-availability-changes-in-exchange-server-2013-cumulative-update-1.aspx)

Now CU1 is available it&#8217;s supported to migrate from Exchange 2010 SP3 to Exchange 2013. The organizations who are still running Exchange 2007 will need to run at least Rollup 10 for SP3.

But now Microsoft has &#8220;finished&#8221; his job it&#8217;s time for the other vendors in the Exchange eco-systeem to come with support. Because this is sometimes forgotten I decided to do some research. The results are that some vendors are already supporting Exchange 2013 while others are in the middle of a beta or even have planned a beta a few months from now.

I split the software up in three categories:

  * antivirus
  * backup
  * overige utilities

In the tables below an overview per category:

**antivirus:**

[table id=35 /]

**backup/recovery:**

[table id=36/]

**utilities:**

[table id=37/]

As you could see not all vendors are ready for Exchange 2013. So verify every software which you are using against Exchange if the vendor does support it.
