My site is online for a while and I was interested in what other people thought  about my site. I got some comments who where correct. That&#8217;s why I changed my site on some points: you can zoom into pictures, the navigationbar is moved to the top and the text has another color the last thing I added is a search option. This last update needs to be fine-tuned because it does not work always as I want.
