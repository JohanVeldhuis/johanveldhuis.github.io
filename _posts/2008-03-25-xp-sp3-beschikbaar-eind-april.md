According to a lote of rumor sites SP3 vor Vista will be available at the end of April. Microsoft has not confirmed this but tells that they are trying to get it ready before in the first half of 2008. On the internet you can download many beta&#8217;s but Microsoft does not recommend to install them. The funniest is that you can read the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/c/d/8/cd8cc719-7d5a-40d3-a802-e4057aa8c631/relnotes.htm" target="_blank">release notes</a> for SP3 since the begin of this month and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=114f3599-12af-42b2-aab1-b969a62c68a7&DisplayLang=en" target="_blank">RC2</a> can be downloaded from the Microsoft site. When you are looking further in the release notes they appear to be for RC2 and not for the official release so the title of the download is not really clear. RC2 contains a few new features: Network Access Protection, Black hole router detection, Enhanced security for Administrator and Service policy entries and Windows Product Activation. This last feature is also available in products such as Vista, Windows 2008 and Office 2007. You can install the product without a key and then use it for a short period just like a trial.
