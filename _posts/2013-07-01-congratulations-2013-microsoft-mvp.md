Today I received the MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award for the 5th time from Microsoft. This award is valid for one year and each year you have to earn it again.
  
The award is given by Microsoft to people for their work in the community. What the exact things are they will look at is still a black-box.

You can become a MVP in several categories from Excel to Exchange. In this last categorie I received the MVP award. Besides me several other people received the MVP award among them The UC Architects Steve Goodman, Paul Cunningham and Justin Morris.
