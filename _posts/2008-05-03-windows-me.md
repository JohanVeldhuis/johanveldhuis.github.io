It has been a while ago since I installed Windows ME on a pc but today I did have to do it. It&#8217;s really cool the setup goes really fast when you compare it with Vista. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t release any new patches for Windows ME, during Windows update you will get a nice warning that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t give support anymore on the product. It was nice working again with Windows ME, but I will go back to Vista, I begin to like it ðŸ˜‰
