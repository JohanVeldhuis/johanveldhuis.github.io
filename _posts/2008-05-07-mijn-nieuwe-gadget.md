Yesterday I got a nice present, a PS3. It’s a really cool thing, I looked at it for a while, but thought it will come in the future. Last week I played with my PS2 again, it was a while ago that I did that, and I can say it’s a different experience then playing games on your PC. Tonight I am gone play again and download some demo’s via the PS network.
