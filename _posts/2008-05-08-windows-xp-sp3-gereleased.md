Microsoft has release servicepack 3 yesterday although it was nog clear if it would be really released. The plan was to release the servicepack last week but was stopped because it gave some issues with specific software. In the meantime a patch is released for this software. The new servicepack contains a lot of security updates en not many new functions. The servicepack includes: support for WPA2, Network Access Protection and MSXML6.

Microsoft removed one function which was planned to be available in the service pack. Microsoft had plans to make is possible to view the adresbar from Internet Explorer in the taskbar. Microsoft did this because of a legal issue they had with the European Commission.
