I amÂ waiting on Schiphol to depart to Cork.Â The checkin has been automated this days, it is really nice. Just had some lunch andÂ now I have to wait till 20:10 because boarding then starts. I read on the Xs4all site that if you are a member of them you can use KPNÂ Hotspots for free. ItÂ doens&#8217;t go really fast but for surfing the internet it&#8217;s OK, at home I have a 20 Mbps connection so comparing with that it&#8217;s slow ðŸ˜‰

I am very curious what Trend will present in Cork, but when I have some time I will publish it on my site. I can&#8217;t bring to much outside I think butÂ  I will keep you informed.
