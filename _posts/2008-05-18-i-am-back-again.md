As many other people may website was also suffering the KPN/Xs4all problems which were in the Netherlands. Since today everything is working fine, although the line is dropping sometimes, but maintenance will be done in a couple of days. Meanwhile the infrastructure behind the ADSL modem is adjusted because there was a cable between it which gave some issues. But the site is online again and that is the importantst. I think the problems last week have shown use how weak the network is and that you really are dependent now a days. Tomorrow evening I will travel to Cork (Ireland) to the Trend Micro University. I really wander what I will see there, when I have time I will put some info on my blog about it.
