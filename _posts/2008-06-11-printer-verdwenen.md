A while ago I bought a news printer because the other printer had some problems. I found out that sometimes my printer dissapeared for a strange reason. Therefore I decided to google if there was a solution for the issue. It didn&#8217;t take much time to find a solution for this issue, there were more people who had this issue. HP use a service to detect the printer, there is only a  small bug  in it,  the service ensures that when the service cannot the printer find the printer will be removed. This service starts rather if you have network connection or not, if you don&#8217;t have the printer will be deleted. As work-around I have now turned off the HP CUE deviceDiscovery service and the problem has been now solved.
