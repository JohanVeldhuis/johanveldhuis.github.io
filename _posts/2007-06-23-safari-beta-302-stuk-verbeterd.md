[![Safari](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/safari.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/safari.jpg "Safari")

Today a new build is released of Safari for Windows. I don&#8217;t have found the issues that were in the previous builds so that&#8217;s nice. You can see that Apple wants to launche their browser a.s.a.p. On the website there&#8217;s a note that it contains both bug fixes and security fixes. We are going further testing Safari for bugs.
