WordPress 2.7 is released and I thought why not let&#8217;s install it because most plug-ins were compatible with version 2.7. After upgrading and some testing I reverted to version 2.6.5 this because 2.7 did not work well with some plug-ins. You may have seen that my site was not online for a while, sorry for that. I put the update on hold for a while ðŸ˜‰
