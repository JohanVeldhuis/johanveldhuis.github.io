It&#8217;s time for a new tutorial, this time it&#8217;s about the UM part of Exchange 2007.

Such as a lot of other software packages Exchange also has language-packs, the language packs are also available for the voice access part, among which Dutch. I must say that the quality and pronouncement of it is really good. But that&#8217;s my personal judgement, try out yourself to make your own judgement.
