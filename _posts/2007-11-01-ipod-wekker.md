[![iPod wekker](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ontime_black_1_310106.thumbnail.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/ontime_black_1_310106.jpg "iPod wekker")

This new alarm clock I found during surfing the internet. The vendor of the alarm clock is a famous one Harman Multimedia. The iPod can be put in the alarm clock and will awake you with the music you want. The alarm clock has 4 JBL speakers and has a iPod dock connector. Besides this the alarm clock has a few other connections that you can use to connect other MP3 players to it. More information can be found on the site of Harman Multimedia and if you want to buy it visit theÂ Apple Online Store.
