Today rollup 5 for Exchange 2007 is released. This update contains fixes for:

  * OWA displays a blank page after the installation of rollup 3 or 4
  * the Unified Messaging part of Exchange 2007 may have issues with the diversion header in some cases
  * the OAB can not be copied from the OAB share which is hosted on a Windows 2008 server when Exchange is used in a CCR environment

These are a few fixes, for a complete overview visit the site below.
