It has been a while but since this week I am back online thanks to my neighbour.  My own provider hasn&#8217;t been able to arrange the new connection despite several phone calls and a letter which mentioned the line should be working on 21-7.

Nevertheless, last week Rollup 9 for Exchange 2007 SP1 which contains several fixes. One of the fixes is to improve the performance of ESEUtil when running it on a Windows 2008 R2 system.

Besides this SP2 for Exchange 2007 will be released soon, so a lot of news about Exchange.

For a full overview of fixes in Rollup 9 visit the site below.
