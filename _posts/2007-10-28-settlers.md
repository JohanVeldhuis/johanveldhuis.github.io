This weekend I have been busy with Settlers. A nice game what is not easy so that&#8217;s cool because else you will be finished too soon. At this moment I am busy with Heritage of the Kings but I had a quick look at the new version Rise of an Empire. I must admit that the guys from Ubisoft delivered nice work. You will get addicted soon to the game, when busy with a level you will be busy for a few hours.
