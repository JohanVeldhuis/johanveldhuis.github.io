Since the release of Exchange 2010 Service Pack 1 the steps for configuring OCS/Lync IM integration for OWA has changed.

To simplify this proces I created a script which performs the following tasks:

  * check if the correct software and patches are installed;
  * configure the OWA virtual directory;
  * restart IIS;

The script will need to be executed from the CAS server and does only work for Exchange 2010 SP1. Besides the Exchange part don&#8217;t forget to configure the OCS/Lync side.
