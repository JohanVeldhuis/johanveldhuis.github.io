Access-based enumeration makes it possible to hide the directories and files for people who don&#8217;t have access on them. When ABE is installed you will get an extra tab when a directory is shared. Here you can choose to activate ABE or not. ABE can be activated for all shares on a system or per share. In Windows 2008 this piece of software is build-in an doesn&#8217;t need to be installed seperatly.
