Install a rollup for Exchange, that&#8217;s the way it goes most times. But in some cases it can go wrong, OWA doesn&#8217;t work anymore after an upgrade is an example of this. To prevent this from happening Amit Tank (MVP Exchange) wrote an article where he explains which steps to be performed before installing the rollup. Besides this he also explains which logs are createdÂ in case you need to troubleshoot an issue.
