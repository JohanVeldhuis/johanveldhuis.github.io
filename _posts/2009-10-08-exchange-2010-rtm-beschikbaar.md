Yes it&#8217;s here the RTM version of Exchange 2010. At 9:00AM local  time in the US a blog is posted on MsExchangeteam.com by the Exchange Team. The RTM status means that the software will be available for a selective group of people.  Suspected is that Exchange 2010 will be available for everyone early November, it will be launched during TechEd Berlin.

As not everybody can be in Berlin or Las Vegas Microsoft has launched a special website where you can see the launch live.
